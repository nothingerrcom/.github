## About

Nothinger is an organization dedicated to creating innovative solutions from minimal starting points. We believe in the power of simplicity, clean architecture, and maintainable code that stands the test of time.

## Our Philosophy

- **Start with nothing** - Build only what's necessary
- **Optimize for humans** - Code should be readable and maintainable
- **Long-term thinking** - Design for the next decade, not just next month
